Scripts for two assignments in medical MRI analysis. 
Assignment 1:
 - Masksimple (left/right and right/left thresholding)
 - Maskfull (same for 3D)
 - nonlincurvefit (implementation of lsqcurvefit for T1 and PD estimation from FLASH sequence)
 - slicei (Function for visualizing 4D images)
 - ass12 (collects above functions for report 1)
 
Assignment 2 on magnetic resonance spectroscopy:
 - FID (simulate an FID signal given weights and ppm values)
 - specGLM (perform GLM estimation of FID spectra - not completely done)
 - MRIass2 (complete GLM estimation and concentration calculation on real data)
